# Research Use Disclaimer

## Important Notice

**THE PATHWAY SUBTYPING FRAMEWORK IS PROVIDED FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.**

This software and its outputs are intended solely for:
- Scientific research and exploration
- Hypothesis generation
- Educational purposes
- Method development and benchmarking

## Not for Clinical Use

This framework is **NOT** intended for and should **NOT** be used for:

- Clinical diagnosis of any disease or condition
- Treatment selection or modification
- Genetic counseling without professional oversight
- Medical decision-making of any kind
- Insurance, employment, or legal decisions
- Prenatal screening or selection
- Any application affecting patient care

## No Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

## Limitations

Users must understand that:

1. **Subtypes are hypotheses**: Clustering results represent statistical patterns, not validated biological entities
2. **No causality**: Pathway associations do not establish causal relationships
3. **No individual prediction**: Results describe group patterns, not individual outcomes
4. **Validation required**: All findings require independent experimental validation
5. **Context-dependent**: Results may not generalize across populations or datasets

## Appropriate Use

Before using this framework, users should:

- [ ] Read and understand the [Limitations](docs/limitations.md) document
- [ ] Understand the statistical methods employed
- [ ] Have appropriate expertise in genomics and bioinformatics
- [ ] Plan for independent validation of any findings
- [ ] Consider ethical implications of their research

## Citation

If you use this framework in published research, please cite appropriately and include a statement acknowledging the research-only nature of the tool.

## Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

## Data Provenance and Integrity

**This project contains zero proprietary, commercial, or third-party customer data.** The authors affirm the following:

### What IS in this repository

| Data Type | Location | Origin | Contains Real Patient Data? |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----------------------------|
| Synthetic VCF | `data/sample/synthetic_cohort.vcf` | Computationally generated by `SyntheticDataGenerator` using random number generators with fixed seeds | **No** — all variants, genotypes, and sample IDs are fabricated |
| Synthetic phenotypes | `data/sample/synthetic_phenotypes.csv` | Computationally generated alongside the synthetic VCF | **No** — all sample IDs, ages, and subtype labels are fabricated |
| Pathway gene lists | `data/pathways/*.gmt` | Curated from publicly available, peer-reviewed scientific literature and open-access databases (SFARI Gene, KEGG, Reactome, MSigDB, Gene Ontology) | **No** — gene symbols are standard public scientific identifiers |
| Source code | `src/pathway_subtyping/` | Original implementations by the author, using standard open-source libraries | **No** — contains algorithms, not data |
| Test data | `tests/` | Generated in-memory by test fixtures using `numpy.random.RandomState` | **No** — ephemeral synthetic data for unit testing |

### What is NOT in this repository

- No real patient data, clinical records, or protected health information (PHI)
- No data from any employer, client, customer, or commercial entity
- No data obtained under any Data Use Agreement (DUA) or Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)
- No proprietary databases, licensed datasets, or subscription-access content
- No data from any Life Sciences company, pharmaceutical company, or healthcare organization
- No data copied, derived from, or inspired by any commercial or institutional database

### Independence Statement

This project was developed entirely as an independent, personal research initiative. It was not created as part of any employment, consulting engagement, or commercial project. All code was written from scratch by the author using publicly documented statistical methods and standard open-source libraries (scikit-learn, scipy, numpy, pandas). The author had no access to, and did not use, any proprietary data or proprietary software in the creation of this framework.

### Verification

The provenance of all data in this repository can be independently verified:

1. **Synthetic data**: Run `python -m pathway_subtyping.cli run --config configs/test_synthetic.yaml` to regenerate the synthetic dataset from scratch using the deterministic seed. The output is identical each time because the data is purely algorithmic.
2. **Pathway gene lists**: Every gene symbol in the GMT files can be verified against the publicly accessible databases cited in `data/pathways/README.md` (SFARI Gene, KEGG, Reactome, Gene Ontology).
3. **Source code**: The entire git history is public, showing all code was developed through original commits. No external data files were ever imported from private sources.

## Questions

If you are uncertain whether your intended use is appropriate, please:
1. Consult with a biostatistician
2. Consult with a genetic counselor (for any clinical context)
3. Open a discussion on the GitHub repository
