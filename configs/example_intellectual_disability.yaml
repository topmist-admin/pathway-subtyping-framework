# Intellectual Disability-specific notes:
# - Significant overlap with autism genes (~50%)
# - Consider using autism pathways as starting point
# - IQ severity is key phenotype (mild/moderate/severe/profound)
# - Adaptive behavior scales (Vineland) correlate well
# - DDD study and DECIPHER are key data sources
# - Syndromic vs non-syndromic distinction may emerge
