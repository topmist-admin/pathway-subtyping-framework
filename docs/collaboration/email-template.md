## Template: Initial Outreach

**Subject:** Collaboration opportunity: Pathway-based subtyping for [Disease] research

---

Dear Dr. [Name],

I'm reaching out regarding your work on [specific research area/recent publication]. I've developed an open-source framework for identifying molecular subtypes in genetically heterogeneous diseases, and I believe it could be valuable for your [Disease] cohort.

**The challenge:** [Disease] involves hundreds of risk genes across diverse biological pathways, making it difficult to identify coherent patient subgroups using gene-level analysis alone.

**Our approach:** The Pathway Subtyping Framework aggregates rare variant burden at the pathway level, then uses unsupervised clustering with built-in validation gates to identify reproducible molecular subtypes.

**Key features:**
- Disease-agnostic design (pre-built pathways for autism, schizophrenia, epilepsy, intellectual disability)
- Rigorous validation: permutation tests, bootstrap stability, negative controls
- Your data stays on your infrastructure
- Open-source with Zenodo DOI for citation

**What I'm looking for:**
- Collaborators to validate the framework on independent cohorts
- Domain expertise to refine pathway definitions
- Potential co-authorship on subtype discovery publications

**Try it now:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/topmist-admin/pathway-subtyping-framework
- Colab demo (no installation): [Colab link]

Would you be interested in a brief call to discuss whether this could be useful for your research? I'm happy to walk through the framework and answer any questions.

Best regards,
[Your name]

## Template: Follow-up (7 days)

**Subject:** Re: Collaboration opportunity: Pathway-based subtyping for [Disease] research

Dear Dr. [Name],

I wanted to follow up on my previous email about the Pathway Subtyping Framework. I understand you're busy, so I'll keep this brief.

Since my last email, [mention any updates: new disease pathways added, publication milestone, new collaborator, etc.].

If you'd prefer, I can send a one-page summary of the framework, or you can try the browser-based demo directly: [Colab link]

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
[Your name]

## Template: Conference/Meeting Follow-up

**Subject:** Following up from [Conference Name] - Pathway subtyping collaboration

---

Dear Dr. [Name],

It was great meeting you at [Conference Name] and discussing your work on [topic]. As I mentioned, I've been developing a framework for pathway-based molecular subtyping that might complement your [Disease] research.

I've attached a one-page overview. The key differentiator is our validation approach—we include multiple negative controls to ensure subtypes reflect real biology rather than statistical artifacts.

Happy to set up a call whenever convenient for you.

Best regards,
[Your name]

## Tips for Effective Outreach

1. **Personalize**: Reference their specific work or recent publications
2. **Be specific**: Mention which disease/cohort you're interested in
3. **Lower barriers**: Include the Colab link for no-install demos
4. **Follow up**: Send a polite follow-up after 7 days if no response
5. **Track responses**: Keep a spreadsheet of outreach status
