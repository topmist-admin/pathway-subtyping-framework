## Quick Start

1. **Read** [01-getting-started.md](01-getting-started.md) for onboarding steps
2. **Identify** a disease area you want to study
3. **Apply** for data access using templates in [03-data-sources/](03-data-sources/)
4. **Set up** your environment per [06-technical-setup.md](06-technical-setup.md)
5. **Run** the framework following [07-analysis-workflow.md](07-analysis-workflow.md)

## Research Impact

This framework enables discovery of molecular subtypes in genetically heterogeneous diseases:

- **Autism Spectrum Disorder** - Pilot study (SFARI data application submitted)
- **Schizophrenia** - Planned
- **Epilepsy** - Planned
- **Intellectual Disability** - Planned
